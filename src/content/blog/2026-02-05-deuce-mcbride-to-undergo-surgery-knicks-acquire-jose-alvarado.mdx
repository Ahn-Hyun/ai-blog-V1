# Deuce McBride Injury Update: Knicks Trade for Jose Alvarado Following Surgery News

The New York Knicks face a significant roster adjustment approaching the final stretch of the 2025-26 season. Following weeks of medical uncertainty, the organization confirmed a diagnosis for reserve guard **Deuce McBride** that necessitates surgical intervention. This development prompted the front office to execute aggressive moves at the trade deadline to address the sudden gap in the backcourt depth chart.

### TL;DR
*   **Surgery Scheduled:** Miles McBride will undergo surgery for a core muscle injury (sports hernia) on Friday, February 6, 2026 [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)].
*   **Recovery Timeline:** Reports indicate McBride may be sidelined for the remainder of the regular season, with a potential return targeted for the start of the playoffs [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)].
*   **Roster Move:** The Knicks traded Dalen Terry, two second-round picks, and cash to the New Orleans Pelicans for guard Jose Alvarado [[Heavy Sports](https://heavy.com/sports/nba/new-york-knicks/jose-alvarado-trade-miles-mcbride-injury/)].
*   **Statistical Impact:** The team must replace McBride's career-best production of 12.9 points per game and 42% three-point shooting [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)].

### Surgical Intervention and Prognosis

New York Knicks guard Miles McBride is scheduled to undergo surgery on Friday to repair a core muscle injury, commonly known as a sports hernia [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)]. This diagnosis clarifies his status after the 25-year-old was previously listed with "left ankle injury management" during a recent five-game absence.

Fred Katz of *The Athletic* reported that the procedure could sideline McBride until the start of the playoffs [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)]. While a postseason return remains plausible, the recovery timeline suggests he will not have the opportunity to ramp up during the remaining regular season games.

### Timeline of Health Struggles

The path to this diagnosis began with a high ankle sprain on December 7, 2025, which forced McBride to miss eight games [[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2026/02/03/sports/miles-mcbride-undergoes-tests-on-ailing-ankle-as-knicks-seek-answers/)]. Although he returned for 15 appearances, he was eventually sidelined again leading up to February 3, 2026. Medical staff continued to evaluate his condition as he sat out a recent victory over the Wizards.

A discrepancy exists between earlier reports and the current diagnosis. While the team officially listed his status as "left ankle injury management," the scheduled operation addresses a core muscle injury [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)]. It remains unclear if the ankle and core muscle issues were concurrent ailments [[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2026/02/03/sports/miles-mcbride-undergoes-tests-on-ailing-ankle-as-knicks-seek-answers/)]. Regardless, the pivot to surgery confirms the Knicks cannot rely on internal improvement from McBride until the playoffs.

### Strategic Response: The Alvarado Trade

Recognizing the severity of the situation, the Knicks executed a trade for New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado to mitigate the impact of McBride's extended absence [[Heavy Sports](https://heavy.com/sports/nba/new-york-knicks/jose-alvarado-trade-miles-mcbride-injury/)]. Reports indicate McBride's medical status was the "primary driver" for the deadline move. The transaction sent Dalen Terry, two second-round picks, and cash considerations to New Orleans [[Heavy Sports](https://heavy.com/sports/nba/new-york-knicks/jose-alvarado-trade-miles-mcbride-injury/)].

Acquiring Alvarado provides immediate depth and addresses the specific point-of-attack pressure the coaching staff values. By utilizing draft capital and a young player to duplicate a skill set already present on the injured list, the Knicks prioritized short-term defensive consistency over asset preservation [[Heavy Sports](https://heavy.com/sports/nba/new-york-knicks/jose-alvarado-trade-miles-mcbride-injury/)].

### Statistical Impact and Roster Void

Losing McBride is a statistical blow, as he was posting career-best numbers. Under Coach Mike Brown, McBride averaged 12.9 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 2.8 assists in 28.0 minutes per game during the 2025-26 campaign [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)].

The most difficult attribute to replicate is his efficiency; he shot 43.4% from the field and a career-high 42% from three-point range [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)]. This spacing capability was essential for offensive fluidity. The team must now rely on their new acquisition to replace this production until McBride's potential postseason return.

### Comparison Table: Roster Management Options

| Option | Best for | Pros | Cons | Pricing/Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Development** | Asset preservation | Retains draft picks and young players like Dalen Terry. | Leaves a significant rotation gap; risks defensive drop-off. | None (current roster) |
| **Trade for Jose Alvarado** | Immediate impact | Provides backcourt depth; mitigates McBride's absence; adds veteran experience [[Heavy Sports](https://heavy.com/sports/nba/new-york-knicks/jose-alvarado-trade-miles-mcbride-injury/)]. | Requires giving up assets; duplicative skill set if McBride returns early. | Dalen Terry, 2 second-round picks, cash [[Heavy Sports](https://heavy.com/sports/nba/new-york-knicks/jose-alvarado-trade-miles-mcbride-injury/)] |

### Pros and Cons: The Trade for Jose Alvarado

*   **Defensive Continuity:** Provides similar point-of-attack pressure.
*   **Insurance:** Protects seeding potential against uncertain recovery timelines.

**Cons**
*   **Asset Depletion:** Required parting with Dalen Terry and draft capital [[Heavy Sports](https://heavy.com/sports/nba/new-york-knicks/jose-alvarado-trade-miles-mcbride-injury/)].
*   **Shooting Replacement:** Difficult to replicate McBride's 42% three-point efficiency [[Hoops Rumors](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2026/02/miles-mcbride-to-undergo-surgery-may-be-sidelined-until-playoffs.html)].
*   **Roster Redundancy:** Potential for overlapping skill sets if McBride returns for the playoffs.

### Conclusion

What began as ankle management evolved into a long-term absence, removing a career-best contributor from the lineup.
