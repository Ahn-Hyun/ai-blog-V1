### Strategic Analysis: Fielding First
A key strategic decision for the captains will be the toss. Reports suggest that electing to field first is a frequent tactic in warm-up fixtures to gauge conditions [Outlook India](https://www.outlookindia.com/sports/cricket/nepal-vs-uae-icc-t20-world-cup-2026-warm-up-match-toss-update-playing-xis).

**Pros**
*   **Pitch Assessment:** Fielding first provides a controlled environment to gauge how the surface conditions at the MA Chidambaram Stadium might evolve, which is critical data for the upcoming official matches.
*   **Bowling Calibration:** It allows the captain to experiment with field placements and bowling changes without the immediate pressure of defending a total.
*   **Chase Simulation:** The choice suggests a desire to practice pacing a run chase after attempting to restrict the opposition to a manageable total.

**Cons**
*   **Defensive Practice Missed:** By choosing to chase, a team opts out of testing their ability to set and defend a target, a scenario they will likely face in the group stages.
*   **Scoreboard Pressure:** If the opposition's aggressive top-order players, such as Muhammad Waseem, capitalize on the conditions, the chasing team risks facing a daunting total.

### Scheduled Squads and Match Proceedings
The proceedings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium will feature strong lineups from both nations. Nepal's playing XI is expected to be led by captain Rohit Paudel, including key figures such as wicketkeeper Aasif Sheikh, opener Kushal Bhurtel, and leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane.

### Previous Form and Preparation
Before facing international opponents like the UAE, Nepal tested their form against local opposition to assess match fitness. Reports indicate Nepal played a practice match against the Mumbai Cricket Academy (MCA) Presidents XI at the Brabourne Cricket Stadium. This encounter served as a crucial warm-up exercise to gauge the squad's readiness before moving to Chennai. The match reportedly concluded with a decisive result, as Nepal defeated the MCA Presidents XI by 48 runs [[1]](https://www.filmogaz.com/131361).

During that match, the batting unit displayed stability. Nepal posted a competitive total of 183/5 in their allotted 20 overs. A standout performance came from Aarif Sheikh, who anchored the innings with a significant contribution, remaining unbeaten on 66 runs. Defending the total, Nepal's bowling attack effectively contained the MCA Presidents XI to 135/8. Sandeep Lamichhane proved to be the most effective bowler, claiming 3 wickets and playing a pivotal role in stifling the run chase [[1]](https://www.filmogaz.com/131361).

This victory provided positive momentum as the team transitions to the next leg of their practice tour in Chennai.
