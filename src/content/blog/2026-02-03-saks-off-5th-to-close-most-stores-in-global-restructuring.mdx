# Saks Global Restructuring: Store Closures and Strategic Pivot for Saks Off 5th

Saks Global has announced a significant restructuring of its discount retail operations, confirming plans to close nearly 65 storefronts. This reduction affects the company's off-price division, comprising approximately 60 **Saks Off 5th** locations and five Neiman Marcus Last Call stores. The store closures stem directly from Saks Global's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Lodged in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, this legal move allows the retailer to restructure its debts while attempting to stabilize its business operations [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/business/saks-discount-stores-closures)].

To facilitate this process, Saks Global secured approximately $1.75 billion in financing, providing liquidity to maintain operations during the restructuring. However, this funding has necessitated a reduction of the company's retail footprint, specifically targeting its discount division. While reports vary on the exact number of closureswith some sources estimating between 57 and 60 locationsthe reduction represents the elimination of the majority of the chain's 70-store fleet [[NBC 6 South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/saks-off-5th-stores-website-last-call-closing-sales/3757209/)].

## A Fundamental Strategic Pivot

The restructuring plan alters the operational purpose of the Saks Off 5th brand, marking a strategic pivot away from the company's previous discount model. Historically, the retailer supplemented its stock by purchasing merchandise directly for Saks Off 5th to ensure consistent inventory levels. However, the company has announced it will "move away from purchasing merchandise directly" for its discount banner [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/business/saks-discount-stores-closures)].

This decision indicates a shift toward a scarcity model, where inventory levels are dictated by the flow of unsold goods rather than manufacturing orders. The surviving locations will transition into a "true outlet" role, serving strictly as liquidation channels for the parent company's premium banners. Remaining stores will operate primarily as a selling channel for residual inventory from Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman. This integration allows Saks Global to consolidate clearance merchandise into a single, smaller downstream outlet [[Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/most-saks-off-5th-locations-nationwide-close-amid-bankruptcy-proceedings)].

By relying on residual stock, the retailer returns to the original concept of outlet shopping, offering genuine past-season luxury goods rather than derivatives. This operational pivot restores the remaining locations to the traditional role of a clearance outlet for unsold premium goods rather than a standalone retail chain.

## The Remaining Fleet and Geographic Consolidation

The closures will leave a reduced footprint, with only 12 Saks Off 5th locations expected to remain open nationwide. These surviving stores are concentrated in key markets including New York, Florida, New Jersey, Georgia, California, and Texas [[Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/most-saks-off-5th-locations-nationwide-close-amid-bankruptcy-proceedings)]. This geographic consolidation suggests a strategy focused on retaining a presence only in high-density areas where the parent company maintains strong full-line operations.

While a comprehensive list of specific addresses for the surviving locations was not detailed in initial announcements, the consolidation leaves the retailer with a localized liquidation network. Consequently, the changes affect a geographic range spanning 18 states from Connecticut to Hawaii, where many areas will lose access to the physical discount banner [[NBC 6 South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/saks-off-5th-stores-website-last-call-closing-sales/3757209/)].

Regarding the "Last Call" outlet locations, the company specified that five locations are among the confirmed closures. These include stores at Desert Hills and The Outlets at Orange in California, Sawgrass Mills in Florida, and Grapevine Mills and San Marcos Premium Outlets in Texas [[NBC 6 South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/saks-off-5th-stores-website-last-call-closing-sales/3757209/)].

## Liquidation Timeline and Digital Wind-Down

The bankruptcy proceedings have triggered a timeline for winding down operations. For stores not included in the final 12, the closure process involves a split strategy of immediate shutdowns and liquidation sales. Approximately 23 locations were scheduled to cease operations in early February, bypassing the extended liquidation process [[Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/most-saks-off-5th-locations-nationwide-close-amid-bankruptcy-proceedings)]. Conversely, roughly 34 other closing locations began liquidation events in late January.

In conjunction with the brick-and-mortar closures, the digital arm of the discount business is also ceasing operations. The website `saksoff5th.com`, which operates as a separate legal entity, has commenced a wind-down of its business. The online closing sale officially began shortly before the start of in-store liquidation events. Shoppers accessing the site during this liquidation period will encounter markdowns as the company attempts to clear inventory. Reports indicate that deals on the closing website have been observed reaching up to 85% off original prices [[TODAY.com](https://www.today.com/shop/saks-off-5th-stores-closing-bankruptcy-rcna256722)].

## Consumer Policies: Final Sale and Returns

The liquidation process involves strict policies for consumers purchasing remaining stock. All merchandise purchased during these closing events, whether in-store or online, is designated as final sale, meaning no returns or exchanges will be accepted [[NBC 6 South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/saks-off-5th-stores-website-last-call-closing-sales/3757209/)]. This policy applies to closures affecting major markets including California, Florida, New York, and Texas.

While new purchases are non-refundable, the retailer has maintained standard protocols for transactions completed prior to the wind-down announcement. Returns and exchanges for items purchased before the closing sales commenced will still be accepted in accordance with the company's usual policies [[TODAY.com](https://www.today.com/shop/saks-off-5th-stores-closing-bankruptcy-rcna256722)]. Customers with pending orders or recent deliveries should verify their purchase dates to determine eligibility.

## Critical Deadlines for Gift Cards and Loyalty Points

Customers holding gift cards or loyalty rewards face deadlines to utilize their remaining balances. According to reports from CNN and NBC 6 South Florida, Saks Global has established the following cutoff dates [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/business/saks-discount-stores-closures)] [[NBC 6 South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/saks-off-5th-stores-website-last-call-closing-sales/3757209/)]:

*   **Gift Cards (Online):** Valid for online purchases only until February 13.
*   **Gift Cards (In-Store):** Valid for in-store use through February 14.
*   **Loyalty Rewards (Online):** Members must redeem rewards online by February 28.
*   **Loyalty Rewards (In-Store):** Members must redeem rewards at remaining physical stores by March 1.

The loyalty program is winding down, with new purchases no longer earning rewards points. Because the digital entity is dissolving, customers should prioritize resolving any outstanding online orders immediately.

## Conclusion

The restructuring of Saks Global represents a definitive shift for the **Saks Off 5th** brand. By securing $1.75 billion in financing and shedding approximately 60 locations, the company aims to stabilize its operations through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The transition to a "true outlet" modelrelying solely on residual inventory from Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodmansignals a retreat from the "made-for-outlet" strategy that previously drove expansion. While 12 locations will remain to serve key markets, the closure of the digital platform and the majority of the physical fleet marks a significant contraction for the luxury discount retailer.
