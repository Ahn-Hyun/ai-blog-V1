# NYT Strands Hint: Solving the Formidable Flock Puzzle (Game #91)

For players tackling the New York Times Strands puzzle identified as Game #91, the challenge presents a distinct biological theme. The board opens with a cryptic clue designed to guide the search for hidden words. For those seeking a **strands hint today**, understanding the relationship between the clue and the board's specific geography is essential for solving the grid [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/nyt-strands-today-answers-hints-2-february-2026).

### Analyzing the Theme: Formidable Flock

The official theme for this puzzle, "Formidable flock," suggests a biological classification [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/strands-nyt-hint-february-2-2026). This clue serves as the primary anchor, directing attention toward specific types of animals. Players should interpret "flock" literally to identify the general domain, while "formidable" acts as a modifier describing the nature of the subjects [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/nyt-strands-today-answers-hints-2-february-2026).

Decoding "formidable" is key to narrowing down potential words. While "flock" indicates birds, the modifier suggests species that are imposing due to size, strength, or physical presence. The theme specifically targets "winged animals" rather than a generic collection [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/strands-nyt-hint-february-2-2026). Solvers should look for birds that are often flightless giants or possess massive wingspans.

### The Spangram: Structure and Solution

Structurally, the puzzle features a defining Spangram that connects opposite sides of the board. For this game, the central word spans horizontally across the middle of the grid. It touches the left side of the board at the 5th row and extends to the right side, also ending at the 5th row [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/nyt-strands-today-answers-hints-2-february-2026). This alignment helps players segment the board into upper and lower halves.

The pivotal Spangram answer is "BIGBIRDS." This eight-letter compound word anchors the grid, addressing the prompt regarding a "formidable" group. [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/strands-nyt-hint-today-formidable-flock-february-2-2026) notes that the solution acts as a descriptive label while playfully alluding to a well-known *Sesame Street* character. Tracing the path from the "B" on the far left to the "S" on the far right locks in the yellow theme word.

### The Full Solution List

Identifying "BIGBIRDS" clarifies the search for the remaining theme words, which consist of large avian species. The vocabulary associated with the theme encompasses species known for their size or distinct characteristics. Solvers should anticipate finding names such as "Ostrich" and "Condor" [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/strands-nyt-hint-february-2-2026).

To fully resolve the puzzle, players must find the remaining associated words:
*   "Penguin"
*   "Ostrich"
*   "Pelican"
*   "Cassowary"
*   "Rhea"
*   "Condor"

These answers validate the Spangram's description, as they represent some of the heaviest and largest birds in the animal kingdom [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/strands-nyt-hint-february-2-2026). Unlocking the Spangram first provides the necessary context to distinguish these names from the surrounding random letters.

### Strategic Analysis of the Grid

The structural configuration of this Strands game presents challenges anchored by its theme. The Spangram is comprised of exactly eight letters, a constraint that requires a relatively direct path across the grid [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/nyt-strands-today-answers-hints-2-february-2026). This length suggests that the word is concise, forcing players to look for specific vocabulary.

Strategically, the start and end points at the 5th row suggest a horizontal scanning approach. Participants benefit from focusing on the middle-to-lower rows to locate the connecting bridge between the edges [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/nyt-strands-today-answers-hints-2-february-2026). By cutting across row 5, the Spangram effectively segments the remaining letters. Once locked in, the remaining "theme words" will likely be clustered in the isolated open spaces above and below this line.

### Conclusion

This puzzle offers a distinct biological challenge by asking players to recall the largest members of the avian world. By understanding the "Formidable flock" theme and identifying the central "BIGBIRDS" Spangram, solvers can efficiently isolate the remaining answers such as "Penguin" and "Cassowary." For those utilizing a **strands hint today**, the key takeaway is the importance of the horizontal split across the 5th row, which organizes the board into manageable sections.
