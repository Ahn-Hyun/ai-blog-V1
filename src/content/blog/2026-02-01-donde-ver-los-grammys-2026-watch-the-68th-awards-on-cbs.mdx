### The CBS Partnership and Broadcast Rights
The primary destination for viewing the 2026 Grammy Awards is determined by the contract between the Recording Academy and CBS. The Academy previously announced a broadcast agreement that ensured the ceremony would remain on the network "through 2026" [[Grammy.com](https://grammy.com/news/the-academy-cbs-announce-10-year-deal-for-the-grammy-awards)]. This specific broadcast marks the continuation of a partnership that has lasted for over five decades. By securing these rights, CBS remains the exclusive home for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards.

The execution of this agreement culminates in the live ceremony scheduled for early 2026. The event is expected to take place in Los Angeles, adhering to the schedule projected during previous contract announcements. This broadcast window allows CBS to capitalize on the viewership associated with the culmination of the music industry's awards season.

By maintaining the show on CBS, the Academy ensures continuity for long-time viewers accustomed to the network's production format and scheduling. The agreement confirms that the awards remain on the network for the 68th annual ceremony [[Grammy.com](https://grammy.com/news/the-academy-cbs-announce-10-year-deal-for-the-grammy-awards)]. Consequently, the primary viewing option for the event continues to be the linear CBS Television Network.

### Viewing Options: Linear and Digital
Access to the 68th Annual Grammy Awards is primarily governed by the exclusive broadcast partnership between the Recording Academy and CBS. This arrangement ensures that the event remains on linear television rather than moving exclusively to a pay-walled streaming environment. For consumers, this means that access to the ceremony in 2026 is included in standard cable and satellite packages that carry local CBS affiliates.

For viewers seeking to watch the ceremony without incurring monthly subscription costs, the broadcast on the CBS network provides a "free" viewing option via over-the-air transmission. Because the [Recording Academy and CBS agreement](https://grammy.com/news/the-academy-cbs-announce-10-year-deal-for-the-grammy-awards) keeps the show on the linear network, the telecast is available to households equipped with a digital antenna within range of a local station. This strategy allows audiences to bypass cable fees while still accessing the live event in real-time.

While the linear broadcast serves traditional audiences, the exclusive rights held by CBS also govern digital distribution methods. The agreement implies that streaming access is tethered to CBS's digital ecosystem and affiliated services. Viewers moving away from cable packages generally rely on these network-specific platforms to access the live feed of the ceremony. This structure requires audiences to navigate the specific subscription tiers associated with the broadcaster's parent company to mirror the live cable experience.

### Timeline and Nominations
The timeline for the 68th edition begins months prior to the broadcast with the official revelation of the contenders. The Recording Academy typically schedules the announcement of nominations in November. This timing is established to allow for the traditional campaigning period and voting processes that occur between the nomination reveal and the final ceremony. The adherence to this schedule provides the industry and the public with a lead-up to the telecast [[Grammy.com](https://grammy.com/news/the-academy-cbs-announce-10-year-deal-for-the-grammy-awards)].

Leading into the scheduled ceremony, the roster of nominees will define the competitive narrative and the distribution of awards throughout the night. The event will showcase established stars alongside emerging talent, maintaining the program's reputation as a comprehensive overview of the year in music.

### International and Spanish-Language Coverage
For Spanish-speaking audiences actively searching for "donde ver los grammys," coverage often extends beyond the broadcast signal to include real-time reporting from major US outlets. Publications typically provide dedicated Spanish-language reporting, detailing the events of the night directly from the venue. This includes immediate updates on winners, such as the translation of categories like "Mejor interpretacin pop do/grupo" for Spanish readers. Such localized coverage is critical for global viewers who may encounter geo-blocking restrictions on US streaming platforms or lack a direct television partner in their territory.
