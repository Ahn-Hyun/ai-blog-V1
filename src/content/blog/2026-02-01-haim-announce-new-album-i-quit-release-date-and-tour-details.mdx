# HAIM Announces New Album 'I Quit': Release Date, Tracklist, and Tour Details

The rollout for **HAIM**'s fourth studio album is scheduled to begin on the evening of April 23, 2025, marking the start of a new era for the Los Angeles trio. During an intimate performance at The Bellwether, the band plans to utilize screen projections of phrases such as "I quit shame" and "I quit fear" to introduce the album's thematic elements. This presentation is expected to culminate in the reveal of the official title, *I Quit*, setting a tone of personal agency and resignation from negative emotional states [Consequence.net](https://consequence.net/2025/04/haim-new-album-i-quit-release-date/).

Following this live debut, a formal announcement on April 24, 2025, will confirm that *I Quit* is set for release on June 20, 2025, through Columbia Records. The 15-track collection features production by long-time collaborator Rostam Batmanglij alongside Danielle Haim, signaling a deliberate continuation of the creative partnerships that have defined the band's recent career [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).

### TL;DR
*   **Album Details:** **HAIM** will release their fourth studio album, *I Quit*, on June 20, 2025, via Columbia Records.
*   **Production:** The 15-track album is produced by Danielle Haim and longtime collaborator Rostam Batmanglij.
*   **Lead Single:** The video for "Down to Be Wrong," directed by Bradley and Pablo and featuring Logan Lerman, is scheduled for release.
*   **Touring:** Confirmed dates include the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and Primavera Sound festivals in Barcelona and Portugal.
*   **Key Themes:** The era is defined by themes of empowerment, highlighted by slogans like "I quit shame" and "I quit fear."

### The Sonic and Visual Identity
The album's continuity extends to the tracklist, which integrates previously released tracks "Relationships" and "Everybody's Trying to Figure Me Out" into the final collection. By compiling these existing singles into the new 15-track LP, the band capitalizes on listener familiarity while introducing the bulk of the new material [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).

For the album's static visual identity, the band has reconnected with acclaimed filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. Reports confirm that the album's artwork is shot by the director, maintaining a visual consistency with their prior campaigns. Anderson has frequently directed music videos for the trio, making his involvement in the *I Quit* era a significant component of their artistic direction [Consequence.net](https://consequence.net/2025/04/haim-new-album-i-quit-release-date/).

### Lead Single and Music Video
Coinciding with the album confirmation, the studio version of "Down to Be Wrong" is slated as the lead single. The accompanying music video is directed by Bradley and Pablo, known for their work with Harry Styles and Charli XCX. Featuring actor Logan Lerman, the video aims to provide a polished counterpoint to the live version debuted at The Bellwether. The inclusion of Lerman continues the band's tradition of incorporating high-profile cameos in their visual media [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).

Listeners can expect their first auditory preview of this era during the band's intimate performance in Los Angeles on April 23, 2025. **HAIM** is scheduled to debut two unreleased tracks, "Blood in the Streets" and "Down to Be Wrong," during the show. These live renditions will provide the primary evidence for the album's musical direction before the release of studio recordings, marking the transition from their previous touring cycle [Consequence.net](https://consequence.net/2025/04/haim-new-album-i-quit-release-date/).

### Live Performances and Touring Schedule
The announcement outlines the band's immediate touring schedule leading up to the June release. Confirmed appearances include the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival on April 27, followed by European dates at Primavera Sound Barcelona on June 6 and Primavera Sound Portugal on June 14. These dates ensure a strong presence in key global markets immediately prior to the album's official drop date [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).

While the summer festival circuit provides a clear immediate roadmap, the full scope of the *I Quit* tour for late 2025 remains partially undefined. Third-party tour aggregators have suggested additional stops, such as the Radio 1 Big Weekend and Fuji Rock Festival, but these dates are absent from the official Sony Music press release. Furthermore, specific details regarding a dedicated UK headline tour have yet to be formally verified by the band's management [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).

### Pros and Cons of the "I Quit" Rollout
The strategy behind **HAIM**'s new album release presents distinct advantages and limitations based on the current announcements.

**Pros**
*   **Established Creative Team:** Continued collaboration with producers Rostam Batmanglij and Danielle Haim ensures sonic consistency [Consequence.net](https://consequence.net/2025/04/haim-new-album-i-quit-release-date/).
*   **Visual Consistency:** The involvement of Paul Thomas Anderson for artwork and Bradley and Pablo for the music video maintains a high cinematic standard [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).
*   **Integrated Tracklist:** Including previously released singles "Relationships" and "Everybody's Trying to Figure Me Out" provides immediate familiarity within the new 15-song collection [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).

**Cons**
*   **Limited Tour Confirmation:** Only three festival dates are officially confirmed, leaving a dedicated headlining tour unverified [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).
*   **Release Timing:** The European festival dates occur before the June 20 album release, meaning audiences will not know the full body of work during the performances.
*   **Unverified Rumors:** Discrepancies exist regarding potential appearances at Radio 1 Big Weekend or Fuji Rock Festival, which were absent from the primary press release [Sony Music Canada](https://www.sonymusic.ca/press_release/haim-announce-the-release-of-new-album-i-quit-out-june-20).

### Conclusion
The upcoming release of **HAIM**'s *I Quit* on June 20, 2025, positions the band to build upon the architectural foundation of *Women in Music Pt. III*. By leveraging established production expertise along with the visual stylings of Paul Thomas Anderson, the trio signals a potential evolution of their existing sound rather than a complete departure. The campaign's launch, characterized by the projection of empowering slogans like "I quit shame" and the release of the Logan Lerman-starring video for "Down to Be Wrong," suggests a thematic shift toward declarative agency.

However, for fans eager to see this new era translated to the stage, the immediate future requires a "wait and see" approach. While appearances at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and Primavera Sound are locked in, the lack of a comprehensive touring schedule leaves the band's long-term trajectory for late 2025 partially undefined. Until further dates are verified by management, the *I Quit* era is currently defined by its strong studio personnel and high-profile visual aesthetics.
