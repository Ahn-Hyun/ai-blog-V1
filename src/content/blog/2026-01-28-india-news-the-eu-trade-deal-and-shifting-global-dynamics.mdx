## Why india news suddenly matters

india news is drawing renewed attention, and not just because of a single headline. Recent coverage points to overlapping signals that frame the story: India-EU trade deal under the looming shadow of Donald Trump - BBC, India comes out on top: Trump aide's big remark after New Delhi's mother of all deals with EU - The Times of India. This column pulls those signals into a single narrative.

## What the reporting reveals

The coverage suggests a broader shift around india news that goes beyond a one-day spike. If you read the reporting closely, the throughline is about momentum and what it implies for the next 6-12 months.
