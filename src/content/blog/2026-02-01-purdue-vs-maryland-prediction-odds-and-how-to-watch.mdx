*   **Broadcast:** 1:00 p.m. ET on CBS [[Hammer and Rails](https://www.hammerandrails.com/mens-basketball/57965/purdue-basketball-how-to-watch-12-purdue-17-4-7-3-at-maryland-8-12-1-8-fan-discussion)].
*   **Key Stat:** Purdue averages 83.2 points per game compared to Maryland's 73.0 [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)].
*   **Betting Insight:** Purdue is a heavy favorite (-15.5 spread) despite a three-game losing streak [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)].

### Team Records and Recent Form

Purdue enters with a 17-4 overall record (7-3 conference), looking to stabilize their standing [[Hammer and Rails](https://www.hammerandrails.com/mens-basketball/57965/purdue-basketball-how-to-watch-12-purdue-17-4-7-3-at-maryland-8-12-1-8-fan-discussion)]. The Boilermakers arrive in College Park on a rare three-game losing streak, including a competitive 72-67 loss to Indiana where a second-half rally fell short [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)].

Conversely, Maryland struggles with an 8-12 record and has secured only one win in nine conference attempts [[Hammer and Rails](https://www.hammerandrails.com/mens-basketball/57965/purdue-basketball-how-to-watch-12-purdue-17-4-7-3-at-maryland-8-12-1-8-fan-discussion)]. The Terrapins are enduring a prolonged slide, recently suffering a 91-48 defeat to Michigan State [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)]. While Purdue aims to maintain its upper-tier status, Maryland is fighting to salvage a difficult season.

### Statistical Breakdown and Key Players

A notable gap exists in offensive production. Purdue averages 83.2 points per game, significantly higher than Maryland's 73.0 [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)]. This ten-point disparity underscores the challenge Maryland faces in keeping pace with high-scoring opponents.

Braden Smith drives Purdue's offensive scheme, averaging 15.1 points and 9.0 assists per game [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)]. His dual-threat ability is critical for a Boilermakers squad that puts up robust scoring numbers.

Rebounding statistics indicate a potentially closer battle. Purdue averages 36.2 rebounds per game, nearly identical to Maryland's 35.8 [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)]. If Maryland can leverage this parity, they may limit Purdue's offensive possessions.

### Betting Landscape and Odds

Purdue is installed as a heavy 15.5-point favorite for this road contest [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)]. This margin suggests analysts view Purdue's recent skid as temporary variance rather than a structural collapse.

Moneyline odds are set significantly apart, with Purdue at -1650 and Maryland as the underdog at +950 [[Pick Dawgz](https://pickdawgz.com/college-basketball-picks/purdue-vs-maryland-prediction-2-1-2026-todays-college-basketball-picks-2026-02-01/)]. Bettors must weigh Purdue's statistical dominance against the potential variance of a conference road game.
