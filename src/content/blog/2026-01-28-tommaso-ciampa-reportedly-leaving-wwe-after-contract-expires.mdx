Reported rumors suggest a significant shift in the professional wrestling landscape, indicating that veteran competitor **Tommaso Ciampa** intends to depart WWE. A former NXT Champion, Ciampa has reportedly decided to exit the promotion following the expiration of his current contract. This development would mark the end of a defining era for the wrestler, who was instrumental in establishing the identity of the NXT brand.

As the industry reacts to these projections, attention has turned to the immediate ramifications. From strategic intellectual property filings hinting at a future character direction to the status of the #DIY tag team, the effects of this potential decision are already being analyzed. This article examines the details surrounding Ciampa's reported departure, speculation regarding his next destination, and the impact on his long-time allies.

## Reported Departure Plans and Contract Status

Sources indicate that Ciampa plans to leave WWE once his existing obligations are fulfilled. According to industry coverage, the wrestler revealed his decision internally, aiming to depart once his deal concludes [Cageside Seats](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/413290/wwe-stock-report-jan-2026-wyatt-sicks-lose-tag-titles-sami-zayn-world-title-natalya-gargano). While the exact termination date remains undisclosed, the timing implies a planned transition rather than an abrupt release, allowing him to negotiate freely on the open market.

Ciampa personally addressed the situation via social media, alluding to a "new journey" in his career [Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/dave-meltzer-speculates-tommaso-ciampas-021814508.html). This acknowledgment aligns with *Wrestling Observer Newsletter* coverage discussing the potential departure. By leaving the promotion where he achieved mainstream acclaim, Ciampa appears to be betting on his ability to reinvent his character outside the WWE ecosystem.

## Strategic Trademark Filings: The Return of the "Psycho Killer"

With his exit reportedly on the horizon, Ciampa has taken legal steps to secure his independent identity. Filings confirm the wrestler is trademarking "Psycho King" and "Psycho Killer," monikers associated with his pre-WWE persona [TheSportster](https://www.thesportster.com/jim-ross-sees-wwe-ciampa-jumping-to-aew/).

These filings suggest a strategy to reclaim intellectual property associated with his independent career. The "Psycho Killer" mark signals a direct return to the moniker that defined his tenure in Ring of Honor. Securing this trademark allows him to market a familiar brand without building from scratch [Jim Ross Sees WWE Star Jumping To AEW As "Logical"](https://www.thesportster.com/jim-ross-sees-wwe-ciampa-jumping-to-aew/).

Additionally, the "Psycho King" filing points to a potential character evolution. This variation offers merchandise opportunities and branding flexibility, providing options depending on the creative direction of his next promotion [Jim Ross Sees WWE Star Jumping To AEW As "Logical"](https://www.thesportster.com/jim-ross-sees-wwe-ciampa-jumping-to-aew/).

## Speculation on Future Destinations: AEW and NJPW

The confirmation of Ciampa's pending exit has shifted attention toward potential landing spots. Industry veterans have weighed in on where the "Psycho Killer" might go next.

### The Case for All Elite Wrestling (AEW)
Commentator Jim Ross has previously stated that seeing Ciampa jump to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) would be "logical" given the wrestler's reputation [TheSportster](https://www.thesportster.com/jim-ross-sees-wwe-ciampa-jumping-to-aew/). Ross noted that Ciampa is "somebody you wouldn't pass on" due to his skill set, though he clarified he holds no insider knowledge regarding active negotiations.

Dave Meltzer provided additional context, speculating that AEW is an obvious choice because Ciampa's style aligns with the product [Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/dave-meltzer-speculates-tommaso-ciampas-021814508.html). While Tony Khan may be open to acquiring high-profile free agents, analysts note the "crowded" AEW roster could complicate Ciampa's placement.

### International Opportunities
Beyond North American competitors, Ciampa's exit opens doors to international markets. Meltzer reported discussions regarding Ciampa potentially appearing for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) [Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/dave-meltzer-speculates-tommaso-ciampas-021814508.html). A run in Japan would align with his physical style and differentiate his post-WWE career.

## The Fallout for Johnny Gargano and #DIY

Ciampa's projected departure has reportedly had a detrimental impact on his long-time partner, Johnny Gargano. Following the news, the #DIY tag team faces dissolution [Cageside Seats](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/413290/wwe-stock-report-jan-2026-wyatt-sicks-lose-tag-titles-sami-zayn-world-title-natalya-gargano).

Gargano has reportedly returned to singles competition on *SmackDown*, sustaining losses that analysts view as "bad news" for his standing [Cageside Seats](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/413290/wwe-stock-report-jan-2026-wyatt-sicks-lose-tag-titles-sami-zayn-world-title-natalya-gargano). Current booking suggests he is being utilized to elevate other talent rather than receiving a renewed push.

## Conclusion

For Ciampa, the move is a proactive decision to control his narrative, evidenced by his trademark strategy and pursuit of new opportunities.
