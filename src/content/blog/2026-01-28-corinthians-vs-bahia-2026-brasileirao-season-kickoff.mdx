The 2026 **Brasileiro** season kicks off with an exceptional, rescheduled fixture that sets an early tone for the national football calendar. As teams prepare for this opening round, the matchup between Corinthians and Bahia highlights contrasting recent trajectories. Scheduled for January 28, 2026, this encounter serves as the debut for both squads in the league campaign, positioned early to accommodate other major competitive commitments.

The context is defined by the disparate momentum from the previous year. Bahia enters looking to validate a historic rise, while Corinthians faces pressure to execute a turnaround under new management. With venue changes, injury concerns, and roster adjustments dominating the pre-match narrative, this opener provides a critical first test.

## TL;DR

*   **Fixture Details:** Corinthians hosts Bahia on January 28, 2026, at 20:00 Braslia time at Vila Belmiro in Santos, moving away from their standard home venue [[Meu Timo](https://www.meutimao.com.br/noticias-do-corinthians/525511/corinthians-encerra-preparacao-para-o-confronto-contra-o-bahia-veja-a-provavel-escalacao)].
*   **Team Momentum:** Bahia arrives after a historic 7th-place finish in 2025, while Corinthians aims to rebound from a disappointing 13th-place league finish [[ge.globo](https://ge.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2026/01/28/corinthians-x-bahia-onde-assistir-ao-vivo-horario-e-escalacoes.ghtml)].
*   **Key Absences:** Corinthians is missing defender Cac and midfielder Jos Martnez; Bahia is without key playmaker Cauly due to injury [[Meu Timo](https://www.meutimao.com.br/noticias-do-corinthians/525511/corinthians-encerra-preparacao-para-o-confronto-contra-o-bahia-veja-a-provavel-escalacao)] [[Bahia.Ba](https://bahia.ba/esporte/cauly-fica-de-fora-da-estreia-do-bahia-contra-o-corinthians-saiba-motivo/)].
*   **Star Watch:** Dutch forward Memphis Depay is listed in the Corinthians squad and may make his 2026 debut, likely starting from the bench [[ge.globo](https://ge.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2026/01/28/corinthians-x-bahia-onde-assistir-ao-vivo-horario-e-escalacoes.ghtml)].

## Logistical Adjustments and Venue Strategy

The 2026 opener features a deviation from standard scheduling. The match will take place at the Estdio Urbano Caldeira (Vila Belmiro) in Santos, rather than the Neo Qumica Arena. This forces the So Paulo-based club to play approximately 70 kilometers from their headquarters, removing the immediate advantage of their home crowd [[ge.globo](https://ge.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2026/01/28/corinthians-x-bahia-onde-assistir-ao-vivo-horario-e-escalacoes.ghtml)].

The relocation is driven by logistical planning. Corinthians requested the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) anticipate this league debut to accommodate travel for the Supercopa Rei. The club is set to compete for the Supercopa title against Flamengo in Braslia on February 1, 2026. Moving the league opener to a mid-week slot in Santos allows the team to manage player load and travel before the cup match [[Meu Timo](https://www.meutimao.com.br/noticias-do-corinthians/525511/corinthians-encerra-preparacao-para-o-confronto-contra-o-bahia-veja-a-provavel-escalacao)].

## Corinthians: Seeking League Redemption

Corinthians enters the 2026 season under head coach Dorival Jnior, tasked with improving upon the previous year's league performance. The club faces pressure to recover from a season where they finished in 13th place. This match offers management an opportunity to reset expectations against a team that outperformed them in the prior league standings [[ge.globo](https://ge.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2026/01/28/corinthians-x-bahia-onde-assistir-ao-vivo-horario-e-escalacoes.ghtml)].

### Roster Constraints and Key Absences
Preparation was complicated by confirmed absences. Defender Cac was ruled out due to an abdominal muscle strain, forcing defensive adjustments. Additionally, midfielder Jos Martnez remains unavailable due to travel document complications; passport issues in Venezuela prevented his timely return [[Meu Timo](https://www.meutimao.com.br/noticias-do-corinthians/525511/corinthians-encerra-preparacao-para-o-confronto-contra-o-bahia-veja-a-provavel-escalacao)].

### The Memphis Depay Factor
Despite setbacks, the squad list includes Dutch forward Memphis Depay. While listed for the opener, reports suggest he will likely start from the bench. His inclusion signals an intent to utilize key assets immediately, providing a high-impact alternative for the second half despite the proximity of the Supercopa final [[ge.globo](https://ge.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2026/01/28/corinthians-x-bahia-onde-assistir-ao-vivo-horario-e-escalacoes.ghtml)].

## Bahia: Building on Historic Success

Bahia arrives following a successful campaign where they secured 7th place, achieving the club's highest ranking in the straight-points era [[ge.globo](https://ge.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2026/01/28/corinthians-x-bahia-onde-assistir-ao-vivo-horario-e-escalacoes.ghtml)]. The team aims to maintain stability and validate their rise as repeat contenders for the upper table.

### Injury Setbacks and Tactical Adjustments
Bahia traveled with 24 players but faced a significant withdrawal. Key midfielder Cauly was ruled out after experiencing thigh discomfort, removing a primary creative option. Without him, the onus falls on captain Everton Ribeiro to orchestrate the midfield transition [[Bahia.Ba](https://bahia.ba/esporte/cauly-fica-de-fora-da-estreia-do-bahia-contra-o-corinthians-saiba-motivo/)].

To compensate, the confirmed lineup features a midfield trio of Acevedo, Jean Lucas, and Everton Ribeiro. The attack includes Erick Pulga, Willian Jos, and Ademir. This configuration suggests a strategy focused on width and experienced finishing to bypass central congestion. Additionally, midfielder Rezende was left out of the squad as a technical option [[Bahia.Ba](https://bahia.ba/esporte/cauly-fica-de-fora-da-estreia-do-bahia-contra-o-corinthians-saiba-motivo/)].
