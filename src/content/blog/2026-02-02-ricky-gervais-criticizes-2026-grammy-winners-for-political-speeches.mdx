On February 1, 2026, **Ricky Gervais** reignited a long-standing debate regarding celebrity etiquette following the broadcast of the Grammy Awards. As winners utilized their acceptance speeches to address political issues, the comedian took to social media to reiterate his disapproval, resurfacing a sentiment that has defined his relationship with Hollywood for over six years. This latest critique highlights a deepening divide between Gervais's "no politics" philosophy and the evolving standards of modern award ceremonies, where social advocacy has become commonplace.

### TL;DR
*   **Ricky Gervais** criticized 2026 Grammy winners, including Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish, for making political statements regarding ICE during the ceremony.
*   The comedian reposted content referencing his 2020 Golden Globes monologue with the caption, "They're still not listening," a tactic he also briefly employed after the 2025 Emmy Awards.
*   Fan reaction was notably mixed compared to previous years, with followers labeling the self-referential post as "cringe" and comparing Gervais to his *The Office* character, David Brent.
*   The incident follows industry pushback at the 2026 Golden Globes, where Wanda Sykes roasted Gervais while accepting an award on his behalf.

## The 2026 Grammy Awards Controversy

The catalyst for the most recent friction was the 2026 Grammy Awards ceremony, held on February 1. During the event, multiple artists, including Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish, used their acceptance speeches to explicitly address the operations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/music/news/ricky-gervais-grammys-political-speeches-bad-bunny-ice-1236649704/). These statements were consistent with modern award show trends, where performers frequently utilize their platform to highlight social causes.

In response, Gervais signaled his continued disapproval of such activism. He shared content referencing his past hosting gigs, captioned with a crying-laughing emoji and the phrase, "They're still not listening." Reports differ on the specific format and platform used for this critique. [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/music/news/ricky-gervais-grammys-political-speeches-bad-bunny-ice-1236649704/) described the content as an excerpt shared on X (formerly Twitter), while [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/ricky-gervais-hammered-for-telling-celebs-to-shut-up-about-ice/) reported it as a screengrab posted to Instagram. Regardless of the medium, the message served to position the artists' advocacy as a failure to heed his warnings about mixing entertainment with political lecturing [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/ricky-gervais-mocks-grammy-winners-making-political-speeches-says-theyre-still-not-listening).

## Origins of the "No Politics" Mandate

The content Gervais recirculated draws from his fifth time hosting the Golden Globes in 2020, a performance defined by its aggressive stance against celebrity culture. In that original speech, he explicitly told the audience, "If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a political platform to make a political speech." He argued that most attendees had spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg and therefore lacked the authority to speak on complex global issues. He famously advised the audience to accept their awards, thank their agents, and "f--- off." This philosophy remains central to his public persona, as he continues to assert that award acceptance speeches should remain strictly expressions of gratitude rather than vehicles for social commentary [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/music/news/ricky-gervais-grammys-political-speeches-bad-bunny-ice-1236649704/).

## A Pattern of Repetition and Deletion

The Grammy incident marks the second time in recent months that Gervais has deployed this specific critique against award winners, establishing a cyclical routine. In September 2025, following the Emmy Awards, he posted the same "They're still not listening" message. [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/music/news/ricky-gervais-grammys-political-speeches-bad-bunny-ice-1236649704/) reported that the earlier post was likely a response to *Hacks* star Hannah Einbender, who had delivered a politically charged acceptance speech during that ceremony.

However, the 2025 instance was short-lived, as reports indicate that Gervais eventually deleted the post regarding the Emmys. This pattern of posting and deleting suggests a potential hesitation or a complex relationship with the feedback he receives, even as he attempts to maintain his role as a vocal critic of Hollywood's political engagement [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/music/news/ricky-gervais-grammys-political-speeches-bad-bunny-ice-1236649704/).

## Comparison table

The following table outlines the two prevailing approaches to award show speeches currently at odds in the entertainment industry.

| Option | Best for | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gervais's "No Politics" Standard** | Viewers seeking escapism and comedy. | Keeps ceremonies streamlined; focuses on the art/performance; avoids alienating viewers with differing political views. | Can be perceived as "cringe" or outdated by modern audiences; limits free expression of winners. |
| **Modern Activist Approach** | Artists wishing to leverage fame for social causes. | Raises awareness for issues like ICE or immigration; utilizes a massive platform for advocacy. | Draws criticism from viewers who prefer "stick to entertainment"; risks backlash from critics like Gervais. |

## Industry Pushback and Audience Fatigue

While Gervais's 2020 monologue originally garnered significant viral attention, his 2026 reiteration faced a more mixed reception. Tensions regarding his relationship with the industry were already visible earlier in the year at the 2026 Golden Globes. During that ceremony, comedian Wanda Sykes accepted a "best TV stand-up award" on Gervais's behalf. Sykes utilized the opportunity to roast the absent Gervais, specifically targeting his history of anti-trans jokes, highlighting the friction between his comedic persona and his peers [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/ricky-gervais-hammered-for-telling-celebs-to-shut-up-about-ice/).

Following the Grammys post, followers on social media criticized the comedian for self-referential behavior. According to [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/ricky-gervais-hammered-for-telling-celebs-to-shut-up-about-ice/), comments compared his behavior to David Brent, the socially oblivious character he played in *The Office*, calling the move "very David Brent-coded." Critics noted the irony of a celebrity using their platform to complain about other celebrities using their platforms, suggesting that the repetition of this grievance may be diminishing the comedic authority Gervais previously held on the subject.

## Pros and cons

**Pros of Gervais's Strategy**
*   **Consistency:** He maintains a clear, unwavering brand regarding the separation of entertainment and politics.
*   **Viral Potential:** His 2020 monologue remains a touchstone for cultural commentary, allowing him to easily insert himself into current news cycles.
*   **Differentiation:** By opposing the industry standard, he distinguishes himself from the "Hollywood elite" he frequently mocks.

**Cons of Gervais's Strategy**
*   **Audience Fatigue:** Reposting the same reaction has led fans to describe the behavior as "cringe" and "stale."
*   **Negative Comparisons:** The behavior has invited unfavorable comparisons to his fictional characters, specifically the delusional David Brent.
*   **Industry Isolation:** Continued attacks on peers have resulted in direct pushback from other comedians, such as Wanda Sykes.

## Conclusion

The conflict surrounding the 2026 Grammy Awards illustrates that **Ricky Gervais** is intent on maintaining his position as the industry's designated critic of celebrity activism. By targeting speeches regarding ICE by artists like Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish, Gervais reaffirmed the "no politics" mandate he established in 2020. However, the reception to this latest critique suggests a shift in the cultural landscape. While his original monologue was hailed as a rebellious act, his recent reliance on reposting old grievances has led to accusations of being "David Brent-coded" and out of touch. As the entertainment community continues to embrace advocacy, it remains uncertain whether Gervais's persistent disapproval will continue to generate meaningful engagement or simply result in audience fatigue.
