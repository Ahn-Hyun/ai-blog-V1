**Pros for Barcelona**
*   **League Dominance:** Entering the contest, Barcelona occupies 1st place with 24 points, doubling the point tally of their opponents [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].
*   **Squad Boost:** There is significant anticipation regarding Gavi, who is expected to potentially make a "long-awaited return" to the squad following his rehabilitation [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

**Cons for Barcelona**
*   **Injury Crisis:** The club faces confirmed absences for key figures including Marc-Andr ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo, Andreas Christensen, Ferran Torres, and Marc Bernal [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].
*   **Tactical Familiarity:** Sevilla is managed by Francisco Garca Pimienta, a former Bara Atltic coach with specific tactical familiarity regarding the home side [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

### League Context and Standings

The disparity between the two teams is sharply reflected in the current league standings. Barcelona asserts early dominance in the 2024-25 campaign, sitting at the summit of La Liga with 24 points [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. Conversely, Sevilla finds itself in 12th place, having secured 12 points from their opening matches. This twelve-point gap highlights the divergent paths the clubs have traversed during the opening months of the season [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

Despite the gap in standings, previews characterize Sevilla as a "well-organized" and "tough" opponent capable of challenging the league leaders [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. A victory at the Estadi Olmpic Llus Companys is essential for Barcelona not just for the three points, but to maintain a buffer against trailing title contenders and ensure they remain at the top of the table [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

### Tactical Preview and Team News

**Barcelona's Selection Challenges**
Hansi Flick enters Matchday 10 with the objective of maintaining Barcelona's position despite significant personnel constraints. The defensive line and goalkeeping positions remain heavily affected by confirmed absences. First-choice goalkeeper Marc-Andr ter Stegen is ruled out, necessitating the continued use of Iaki Pea between the posts [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. Central defense is similarly stripped of experienced personnel, with both Ronald Araujo and Andreas Christensen confirmed as unavailable [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. Consequently, predictions suggest a back four comprised of Jules Kounde, Pau Cubars, Iigo Martnez, and Alejandro Balde [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

In midfield and attack, the absence of Ferran Torres and Marc Bernal further restricts the manager's tactical flexibility [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. However, the squad status offers a mix of uncertainty and optimism; while Frenkie de Jong is listed as a doubt, there is significant anticipation surrounding the potential return of Gavi [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. Given these variables, the predicted midfield configuration involves Marc Casad, Eric Garca, and Pedri operating centrally, with Ansu Fati projected to join regulars Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha up front [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

**Sevilla's Setup and Absences**
Sevilla also contends with roster limitations ahead of the trip to Montjuc. The visitors have confirmed the absences of Tanguy Nianzou and Djibril Sow [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. There is conflicting information regarding defender Loc Bad; while some reports list him among the confirmed absences, he also appears in predicted lineups, suggesting uncertainty about his final status [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

The tactical battle is underscored by the return of Sevilla manager Francisco Garca Pimienta. As a former coach of Bara Atltic, Pimienta possesses intimate knowledge of Barcelona's philosophy [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. Pre-match analysis describes his Sevilla side as "well-organized, tough and know exactly what to do with the ball," indicating a disciplined approach despite their mid-table status [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. Predicted starting arrangements for Sevilla include Nyland in goal, supported by a defensive line likely featuring Carmona and Pedrosa [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

### Officiating and Venue

The match will be officiated by Ricardo de Burgos Bengoechea, who has been assigned as the primary referee. He will be supported by Carlos del Cerro Grande, who is in charge of VAR duties for the fixture [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. Due to the ongoing reconstruction of the Spotify Camp Nou, the game will take place at the Estadi Olmpic Llus Companys in Montjuc, which serves as Barcelona's temporary home for the 2024-25 season [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].

### Conclusion

Entering Matchday 10, the stakes for Barcelona are clear as they look to defend their position at the summit of the La Liga table. A victory in this **Barcelona - Sevilla** clash is essential not just for the three points, but to maintain a buffer against trailing title contenders. Securing a win would reaffirm Barcelona's consistency against lower-ranked opposition and provide momentum before facing higher-caliber European and domestic opponents in quick succession [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)]. While the standings suggest a disparity, the manager must navigate a "monster week" that begins with this fixture, requiring careful squad management amidst a lengthy injury list [[1](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2024/10/20/24271777/barcelona-sevilla-la-liga-team-news-match-preview-lineups-score-prediction)].
