### Early February: A Dual Release Strategy

The month is expected to begin with a significant dual release strategy. On Sunday, February 1, 2026, the 68th Annual Grammy Awards are scheduled to broadcast live from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles at 8 p.m. ET. Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers can access the ceremony in real-time via their local CBS feed. According to [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/paramount-plus/new-on-paramount-in-february-2026-all-the-new-shows-and-movies-to-watch), this event serves as the primary live entertainment pole for the early February lineup.

Simultaneously, the platform is slated to release the exclusive film *Old Guy* on February 1. Starring Christoph Waltz, this action-comedy is a key addition to the service's original movie library. [MovieWeb](https://movieweb.com/every-new-movie-tv-show-coming-paramount-february-2026/) reports the film will be available for streaming immediately as the month starts, providing an on-demand alternative for subscribers not tuning into the live awards ceremony. This scheduling offers an immediate value proposition for users signing up for the Grammys on the same date [[MovieWeb](https://movieweb.com/every-new-movie-tv-show-coming-paramount-february-2026/)].

### Mid-Month: Comedy and Franchise Expansion

Moving into the second week of February, the focus shifts to serialized comedy and family content. On February 12, the Paramount+ Original Series *Can You Keep A Secret?* is listed to premiere its six-episode season in the US. [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/paramount-plus/new-on-paramount-in-february-2026-all-the-new-shows-and-movies-to-watch) highlights this release as a mid-month highlight. Described as a British sitcom, the episodes are expected to be available to stream immediately upon release [[MovieWeb](https://movieweb.com/every-new-movie-tv-show-coming-paramount-february-2026/)].

Concurrently, *Star Trek: Starfleet Academy* is expected to continue its run. New episodes are scheduled to drop weekly on Thursdays, maintaining engagement for the franchise's fanbase [[Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/paramount-plus/new-on-paramount-in-february-2026-all-the-new-shows-and-movies-to-watch)]. Additionally, the second season of the British comedy-drama *Dreaming Whilst Black* is reported to arrive on February 20 [[MovieWeb](https://movieweb.com/every-new-movie-tv-show-coming-paramount-february-2026/)].

Mid-month updates also suggest the arrival of major theatrical intellectual property. [ScreenHub Australia](https://www.screenhub.com.au/news/what-to-watch/paramount-best-new-shows-films-streaming-february-2026-2691822/) reports that *Mission: Impossible  The Final Reckoning* is scheduled to stream on February 19 in Australian markets. The same source lists the animated film *Smurfs* (2025) for a February 24 release. While these dates are confirmed for Australia, US subscribers should treat these dates as estimates subject to regional variation.

### Late February: Procedural Dramas and Broadcast Synergy

A new procedural drama centered on intelligence operatives is set to premiere during the final week of the month. [TV Guide](https://www.tvguide.com/news/new-on-paramount-plus/) lists the US premiere date as February 23 on CBS and Paramount+. International schedules show a slight delay, with [ScreenHub Australia](https://www.screenhub.com.au/news/what-to-watch/paramount-best-new-shows-films-streaming-february-2026-2691822/) placing the series debut on February 24. This model ensures subscribers have immediate access to fresh network content.

The end of February sees a significant influx of returning scripted favorites. On February 26, viewers can reportedly stream the premieres of *Ghosts* Season 5, *Matlock* Season 2, and *Elsbeth* Season 3 [[TV Guide](https://www.tvguide.com/news/new-on-paramount-plus/)]. The expansion continues the following day with the anticipated debut of *Sheriff Country* Season 1 and the return of *Fire Country* for its fourth season on February 27 [[TV Guide](https://www.tvguide.com/news/new-on-paramount-plus/)].

### The Reality Anchor: Survivor 50

The month concludes with the landmark 50th season of *Survivor*. Premiering on Wednesday, February 25, the season is scheduled to begin with a three-hour special. [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/paramount-plus/new-on-paramount-in-february-2026-all-the-new-shows-and-movies-to-watch) notes that the episode will be available live for Premium subscribers. Reports indicate *Survivor 50* will feature 24 returning players, bringing back familiar faces rather than introducing new contestants [[Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/paramount-plus/new-on-paramount-in-february-2026-all-the-new-shows-and-movies-to-watch)].

CBS has allocated a substantial block of primetime programming for this launch. The reported three-hour runtime distinguishes *Survivor 50* from standard season openers [[Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/paramount-plus/new-on-paramount-in-february-2026-all-the-new-shows-and-movies-to-watch)]. The "In The Hands of the Fans" theme suggests a pivot toward fan service, addressing audience desires regarding competitor selection [[TV Guide](https://www.tvguide.com/news/new-on-paramount-plus/)].

### Conclusion

The February 2026 lineup for **Paramount Plus** illustrates a deliberate strategy to bridge the gap between traditional linear television and modern streaming demands. By anchoring the month with the live broadcast of the Grammys and concluding with the massive event of *Survivor 50*, the service maximizes the value of its Premium tier. Simultaneously, the integration of star-driven originals like *Old Guy* ensures a steady flow of content for on-demand viewers. While specific release dates for theatrical blockbusters like *Mission: Impossible* remain subject to regional variance, the coordinated rollout of CBS programming solidifies the platform's position as a digital hub for the network's portfolio.
