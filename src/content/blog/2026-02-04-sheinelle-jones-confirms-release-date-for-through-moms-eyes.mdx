# Sheinelle Jones Confirms Release Date for New Book

NBC *Today* co-host **Sheinelle Jones** has officially set the timeline for her highly anticipated literary debut. Following a period of preparation, Jones confirmed the release schedule for her nonfiction book, *Through Mom's Eyes: Simple Wisdom From Mothers Who Raised Extraordinary Humans*. The announcement solidifies the launch of a project that aims to translate her journalistic work into a permanent resource for parents, blending celebrity insights with themes of empathy and parenting wisdom.

### Official Release Announcement

On January 30, 2024, Jones utilized social media to end speculation regarding the project's timeline. She revealed that the book is scheduled to be published in April 2025 by Harper Select. In her update to followers, she confirmed that the title has been made available for pre-order ahead of the spring launch. This announcement marks the finalization of a schedule that had previously remained uncertain due to necessary adjustments in the publication timeline [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tv/articles/today-sheinelle-jones-shares-project-142533480.html), [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/a70223553/today-show-sheinelle-jones-book-news-instagram/).

### The Journey to Publication

The road to publication involved schedule changes, which Jones addressed directly in her public statements. She expressed gratitude to supporters who "watched the publication date change" so she could ensure the project was completed at the right pace. The finalized date arrives as she continues her broadcasting duties, demonstrating a deliberate approach to the release [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/a70223553/today-show-sheinelle-jones-book-news-instagram/).

Jones explained that the postponement allowed her necessary time to adjust the text to reflect her current reality. She noted that she had to "rework it just a little bit in the front" because her life had evolved since the original draft was completed. Despite the wait, Jones expressed that she "poured her heart" into the project and is eager to share the final result [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tv/articles/today-sheinelle-jones-shares-project-142533480.html).

### From Screen to Page

*Through Mom's Eyes* originated from a recurring segment Jones hosted on the *Today* show, where she interviewed the mothers of high-profile figures. The text compiles insights from these conversations, featuring advice from the mothers of cultural icons such as Lin-Manuel Miranda, Lady Gaga, Stephen Curry, and Shaquille O'Neal. Jones intends for the book to capture the specific advice and perspectives these women shared during their sessions [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tv/articles/today-sheinelle-jones-shares-project-142533480.html), [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/a70223553/today-show-sheinelle-jones-book-news-instagram/).

The transition from a broadcast segment to a written format allows for a deeper exploration of these parenting philosophies. The book is designed to help readers navigate the difficult aspects of motherhood while tapping into joy with "empathy, generosity, and solidarity." By moving from screen to page, the project seeks to preserve the "simple wisdom" of these mothers in a permanent format [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/a70223553/today-show-sheinelle-jones-book-news-instagram/).

### Production and Narration

In addition to the print edition, Jones is deeply involved in the production of the audio version of the release. Responding to inquiries in her Instagram comments, she verified that she will personally narrate the audiobook. By voicing the project, Jones maintains a direct connection with her audience, bridging the gap between her television persona and her role as an author [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tv/articles/today-sheinelle-jones-shares-project-142533480.html).

Currently a co-host on the *3rd Hour of Today*, the author continues to balance her broadcast career with the promotional rollout for the book. With the April release date now set, the project stands as a significant professional milestone [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/a70223553/today-show-sheinelle-jones-book-news-instagram/).
