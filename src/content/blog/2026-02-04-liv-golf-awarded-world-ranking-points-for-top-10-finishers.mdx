# LIV Golf Awarded World Ranking Points Under Strict Conditions

Reports indicate that the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) has outlined a framework for **LIV Golf** League events to receive world-ranking points. This development aims to end the stalemate between the league and the global ranking body. However, the recognition includes a significant caveat: points are awarded exclusively to the top 10 finishers. The vast majority of the field will receive no ranking benefits regardless of their score [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/47817821/liv-golf-get-world-ranking-points-first-only-top-10-players-get-them).

## The "Top 10" Restriction and Scoring Structure

The OWGR designated the events as "small tournament fields" because the league's roster size remains below standard thresholds. Consequently, points usually allocated to lower positions in full-field events are not redistributed to the top 10. This results in a smaller total points pool compared to traditional tournaments [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/47817821/liv-golf-get-world-ranking-points-first-only-top-10-players-get-them).

Competitors finishing 11th or lower receive zero points, statistically treating them the same as a last-place finisher. League officials described the ruling as "unprecedented," arguing it disproportionately harms players who perform at a high level but finish just outside the uppermost tier [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c338x533zyeo).

The board attributed this restriction to "restrictive pathways" for entry. With limited spots filled via the Asian Tour's International Series, the ecosystem lacks the talent churn required for a fully open system [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/47817821/liv-golf-get-world-ranking-points-first-only-top-10-players-get-them).

## Structural Overhaul: 72 Holes and Field Expansion

To secure recognition, the league implemented significant structural changes. Most notably, it abandoned the 54-hole format. Events now feature 72 holes, aligning with the industry standard used by major championships and the PGA Tour [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7018462/2026/02/03/liv-golf-owgr-world-ranking-points-72-holes-majors/).

Although tournaments remain no-cut events, the extension to four rounds addressed a primary obstacle to ranking recognition. This format change was central to the league's effort to integrate into the global ecosystem [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7018462/2026/02/03/liv-golf-owgr-world-ranking-points-72-holes-majors/).

Additionally, the roster expanded to 57 players. However, this figure still falls short of the OWGR's 75-player requirement for full recognition. This specific shortfall triggered the "small tournament field" classification and the subsequent point restrictions [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/47817821/liv-golf-get-world-ranking-points-first-only-top-10-players-get-them).

## Comparative Analysis: The Value of a Win

A victory on this circuit is now valued similarly to a standard DP World Tour win but trails the PGA Tour. Projections estimate that winners will receive significantly fewer ranking points than those awarded at Signature events or major tournaments [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c338x533zyeo).

Without a deeper roster of top-tier players, the "strength of field" formula generates lower point totals. Consequently, these events currently lack the mathematical weight to drastically alter the top of the world rankings immediately [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c338x533zyeo).

## The Path to Major Championships

The OWGR remains the primary mechanism for Major Championship qualification. The top 50 players qualify for the Masters and Open Championship, while the top 60 secure spots in the U.S. Open [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7018462/2026/02/03/liv-golf-owgr-world-ranking-points-72-holes-majors/).

Because points are capped at the top 10, mid-pack finishers will fail to accumulate ranking data. This ruling is critical for high-profile members attempting to maintain their status inside the top 50 [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c338x533zyeo).

Unless players consistently contend for titles, the low mathematical ceiling of these events may prevent them from cracking the critical threshold required for major eligibility [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c338x533zyeo).

## Roster Volatility and Ranking Implications

Roster stability remains a factor in ranking calculations. Any potential departure of major champions to other tours would reduce the aggregate world ranking points available within the league's field. Without a high concentration of top-tier players, the strength of field calculation faces setbacks, further limiting points available to remaining competitors [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c338x533zyeo).

## A Long Road to Accreditation

The decision follows a turbulent administrative saga. The league withdrew an initial application following a rejection in late 2023. At that time, the governing body cited concerns regarding the closed-shop format and lack of relegation [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/47817821/liv-golf-get-world-ranking-points-first-only-top-10-players-get-them).

The application was subsequently resubmitted, coinciding with the strategic pivot to 72 holes. The eventual acceptance indicates that this format change was a necessary concession to reopen dialogue with the ranking body [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/47817821/liv-golf-get-world-ranking-points-first-only-top-10-players-get-them).

## Conclusion

The OWGR's decision to award points to **LIV Golf** establishes a formal, albeit narrow, pathway for players to climb the world rankings. However, the restriction of awarding points only to the top 10 finishers underscores continued hesitation regarding the league's structure. The current arrangement appears to be a transitional step, with further format discussions expected in the future [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7018462/2026/02/03/liv-golf-owgr-world-ranking-points-72-holes-majors/). Until further integration occurs, the pathway to the majors remains open but exceptionally difficult.

## FAQ

**Why are LIV Golf players only receiving points for top 10 finishes?**
The OWGR classified the events as "small tournament fields" because the roster size of 57 players falls below the standard requirement of 75. Additionally, the board cited concerns regarding "restrictive pathways" for entry [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/47817821/liv-golf-get-world-ranking-points-first-only-top-10-players-get-them).

**Will the new OWGR points be enough to get LIV players into the Masters?**
It is possible but difficult. Winners are projected to earn fewer points than PGA Tour Signature events. Players must consistently finish at the top of the leaderboard to crack the top 50 ranking required for a Masters invitation [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c338x533zyeo).

**Why did LIV Golf change to 72 holes?**
The transition to 72 holes was a central component of the effort to align with industry standards used by major championships. This structural change was a necessary concession to reopen dialogue with the OWGR [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7018462/2026/02/03/liv-golf-owgr-world-ranking-points-72-holes-majors/).
