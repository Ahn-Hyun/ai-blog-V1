### Leaderboard and Competitive Landscape

Justin Rose remains a focal point entering the opening 18 holes. The veteran golfer aims to navigate the coastal layout to establish an early pace. As the event transitions into the second day, Rose targets the top of the leaderboard against a strong field attempting to close the gap. Coverage and live scoring will track whether he can maintain momentum through the championship's halfway point [PGA Tour](https://www.pgatour.com/article/news/latest/2026/01/29/how-to-watch-round-2-coverage-details-live-scores-tee-time-featured-groups-times-farmers-insurance-open-golf-channel-espn-xander-schauffele-san-diego-california-brooks-koepka).

While Rose is a favorite, the narrative also focuses on defending champion Harris English. English arrives in San Diego looking to replicate his previous winning form. His performance remains a key storyline as the competition intensifies on the challenging terrain. The ability of past winners to replicate success is often weighed heavily against current form, making English's defense pivotal [Sportsbook Wire](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2026/01/26/farmers-insurance-open-odds-picks-and-pga-tour-predictions/88367918007/).

### Brooks Koepka Returns to the Tour

A major development for the season is the reported participation of Brooks Koepka. Reports suggest the major champion is set to compete, marking a significant moment as he potentially re-enters a standard tour event following his tenure with LIV Golf. The Golf Channel describes Koepka as "one of the golf's most notable names," noting that his entry could suggest a functional pathway for players transitioning back to established PGA Tour competitions [Golf Channel](https://www.golfchannel.com/pga-tour/news/brooks-koepka-2026-pga-tour-odds-farmers-insurance-open-prop-bets).

By selecting the Farmers Insurance Open for his potential return, Koepka would enter a venue known for difficulty and prestige. This move effectively places a major championship winner back into the weekly narrative rather than limiting appearances to the majors. Anticipation surrounds how a returning figure of his stature will measure up against the current weekly PGA Tour roster [Golf Channel](https://www.golfchannel.com/pga-tour/news/brooks-koepka-2026-pga-tour-odds-farmers-insurance-open-prop-bets).

### Course Format and Financial Stakes

The tournament format challenges competitors across two distinct layouts, utilizing both the North and South courses at Torrey Pines for the first two rounds. This rotation requires players to adapt to varying conditions before the field is cut. The split-course format demands versatility; players must maintain momentum while transitioning to the alternate layout, as performance disparities between the courses often dictate early leaderboard dynamics [Sportsbook Wire](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2026/01/26/farmers-insurance-open-odds-picks-and-pga-tour-predictions/88367918007/).

Following the conclusion of Round 2, surviving competitors will consolidate exclusively to the South Course. This transition to a notoriously difficult venue marks a critical turning point in this leg of the West Coast Swing. Only those who successfully navigate the opening challenges across both courses will advance to the final rounds [PGA Tour](https://www.pgatour.com/article/news/latest/2026/01/29/how-to-watch-round-2-coverage-details-live-scores-tee-time-featured-groups-times-farmers-insurance-open-golf-channel-espn-xander-schauffele-san-diego-california-brooks-koepka).

The financial incentives for mastering this challenge are significant. The event features a total purse of $9.6 million, maintaining its status as a financially significant stop on the schedule. This substantial prize fund anchors the tournament as a key early event, motivating both defending titleholders and long-standing tour professionals to perform at their peak [PGA Tour](https://www.pgatour.com/article/news/latest/2026/01/29/how-to-watch-round-2-coverage-details-live-scores-tee-time-featured-groups-times-farmers-insurance-open-golf-channel-espn-xander-schauffele-san-diego-california-brooks-koepka).

### Betting Perspectives and Strategy

The multi-course format presents unique challenges for bettors. The rotation requires analysts to account for potential scoring disparities between the North and South layouts. Prudent strategies often involve waiting for the draw to determine which side plays the potentially easier North course in better weather. Live betting markets may also present opportunities as the disparity in difficulty shifts betting lines [Sportsbook Wire](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2026/01/26/farmers-insurance-open-odds-picks-and-pga-tour-predictions/88367918007/).

Historical performance remains a primary metric, particularly regarding past winners who have demonstrated comfort with the venue. Bettors often weigh course history heavily against current form. However, the potential return of high-profile players like Koepka adds a layer of variance to head-to-head matchups and placement bets [Sportsbook Wire](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2026/01/26/farmers-insurance-open-odds-picks-and-pga-tour-predictions/88367918007/).
