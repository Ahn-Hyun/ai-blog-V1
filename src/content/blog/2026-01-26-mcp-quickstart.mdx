## What is an MCP server?

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is a middle layer that provides a **consistent interface**
for LLMs to call external resources and tools.

## Minimal setup flow

1. **Tool design**: Define input and output schemas.
2. **Resource design**: Define access to files, databases, and HTTP resources.
3. **Prompt design**: Build safe system prompt templates.
4. **Server runtime**: Add request routing and observability (logs/metrics).

## Operational tips

- Monitor tool call failure rates and latency.
- Version prompts explicitly.
- Run regression tests before changing models.

## Checklist

- Are tool input/output schemas documented?
- Is sensitive data prevented from leaking into prompts?
- Are retry/timeout policies defined for failures?
- Are minimal audit logs retained?

## Recommended structure

```
server/
  tools/
  resources/
  prompts/
  middleware/
  telemetry/
```

Separating Tools/Resources/Prompts and centralizing logging/error handling in middleware makes
operations easier.

Handle authentication and authorization centrally so tool implementations do not repeat security
logic.

Set input/output size limits and rate limits on all calls to prevent cost spikes or abuse.

This post is a quickstart overview that will serve as the basis for a deeper tutorial.
