# Fantasy Booking: Matt Cardona and a Potential WWE Return

In this speculative timeline, the landscape of professional wrestling would shift significantly on January 2, 2026, with the projected return of **Matt Cardona** to the WWE roster. This fantasy booking scenario envisions the culmination of a five-year odyssey that saw a former mid-card talent transform himself into one of the industry's most formidable independent brands. Unlike previous returns that relied heavily on nostalgia, this hypothetical reentry is predicated on a substantial reinvention of his character. However, the booking decisions in this narrative raise questions about whether the company would be ready to capitalize on the "Indy God" persona he meticulously cultivated.

### The Independent Reinvention (2020Present)

Following his real-world release from WWE in 2020, Matt Cardona embarked on a campaign to completely reinvent his professional wrestling identity separate from the "Zack Ryder" persona. Moving away from the character that defined his previous tenure, he competed across multiple promotions, including AEW, Impact Wrestling, and Game Changer Wrestling (GCW) [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/).

This period marked his transformation into the self-proclaimed "Indy God," a moniker reflecting his dominance on the independent circuit. His ability to adapt to these varied environments was crucial in establishing a brand distinct from the WWE machine [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/). Cardona's independent run was substantiated by a series of high-profile championship victories. Among his most notable accolades was capturing the GCW World Championship, a win that generated significant buzz. Additionally, he secured the House of Glory Wrestling Championship and held both the AIW Intense and Absolute Championships [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/).

These title reigns demonstrated his capacity to carry promotions as a top-tier attraction. By avoiding the constraints of his previous WWE booking, he demonstrated independent drawing power and created a persona that eclipsed his former mid-card status [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/).

### The "Zack Ryder" Experiment vs. The Brand

In this hypothetical narrative, WWE acknowledges the distinction between Cardona's past and present identities through a specific booking decision projected for late 2025. The scenario posits that on November 14, 2025, the WWE Universe would witness a contained experiment on SmackDown. Cardona would briefly step back into his former persona, appearing specifically as "Zack Ryder" to compete in a "Last Time is Now Tournament," ultimately losing to LA Knight [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/) [Wrestling Inc.](https://www.wrestlinginc.com/2088432/wwe-champion-buzzing-matt-cardona-return-drew-mcintyre/).

This appearance would act as a "control group," isolating the residual popularity of his WWE-created identity against his current momentum. The match is designed to result in a loss, serving as a nostalgic nod rather than a reintroduction. This plot point highlights the ceiling of his past character compared to the potential of his independent evolution [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/).

Following this test, the timeline suggests WWE management would recognize that the nostalgia act has limited longevity. Approximately one month after the tournament loss, Cardona would sign a full-time contract, officially returning to the roster on January 2, 2026, under his real name [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/). This sequencing represents a deliberate creative choice to relegate the "Zack Ryder" character to the past while moving forward with the "Matt Cardona" brand [Wrestling Inc.](https://www.wrestlinginc.com/2088432/wwe-champion-buzzing-matt-cardona-return-drew-mcintyre/).

### Peer Validation and Expectations

In this fantasy booking, the credibility of Cardona's evolution is acknowledged by top-tier talent. Undisputed WWE Champion Drew McIntyre is depicted as publicly praising Cardona's return, comparing the path to his own departure and reinvention. McIntyre notes that Cardona "took the ball and ran with it" after his release, effectively making his name "even bigger outside of the company" by committing to the independent level [Wrestling Inc.](https://www.wrestlinginc.com/2088432/wwe-champion-buzzing-matt-cardona-return-drew-mcintyre/).

McIntyre highlights that Cardona went to the independent circuit rather than immediately jumping to another major televised company. According to the champion's perspective in this storyline, this grind allowed Cardona to establish himself as a returning veteran with proven value, similar to the trajectories of McIntyre himself and Cody Rhodes [Wrestling Inc.](https://www.wrestlinginc.com/2088432/wwe-champion-buzzing-matt-cardona-return-drew-mcintyre/). This endorsement underscores that the November cameo was a momentary look back, while the signing is an investment in his evolved credibility.

### SmackDown Return and Booking Scrutiny

Despite strategic rebranding, Cardona's projected 2026 momentum on SmackDown faces scrutiny in this timeline. The scenario outlines that by January 23, 2026, Cardona would engage in storylines including a backstage exchange with Kit Wilson, followed by a victory over Wilson to mark his first win since returning [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/).

However, this momentum is depicted as stalling after a clean loss to Trick Williams. Wrestling veteran Stevie Richards is cited as criticizing this hypothetical booking, arguing that WWE creative "destroyed any kind of momentum" Cardona had built. Richards points to the lack of narrative build for the match against Williams as evidence of mishandling the returning star [TJRWrestling](https://tjrwrestling.net/news/triple-h-accused-of-destroying-popular-wwe-star/).

The conflict between Cardona's independent accolades and his WWE positioning defines the early stages of this speculative run. Richards speculates that such booking decisions might be a method of "testing" Cardona's attitude to see how he handles adversity [TJRWrestling](https://tjrwrestling.net/news/triple-h-accused-of-destroying-popular-wwe-star/). This creates narrative tension regarding whether WWE will capitalize on the "Indy God" persona or if Cardona will struggle to escape his previous mid-card ceiling.

### Conclusion

As **Matt Cardona** moves forward in this speculative future on SmackDown, the primary challenge remains reconciling the self-made star he became with the creative machinery of WWE. The transition from the "Zack Ryder" nostalgia act to a full-time roster member is solidified by the contract signing, yet the mixed results in the ring suggest his position in the hierarchy would remain fluid. It remains to be seen if WWE creative would fully integrate the "Indy God" persona or if the testing phase described by critics would continue to stifle his momentum [Last Word On Sports](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2026/01/31/why-wwe-wanted-matt-cardona-and-not-zack-ryder/) [TJRWrestling](https://tjrwrestling.net/news/triple-h-accused-of-destroying-popular-wwe-star/).
