With the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics imminent, Team Canada has executed a major roster change just days before traveling to Italy. Carolina Hurricanes forward **Seth Jarvis** has been officially named to the squad, replacing Tampa Bay Lightning center Brayden Point. The February 5 announcement confirms Point is unable to compete due to a lingering injury, ending weeks of speculation regarding his status.

This late adjustment underscores the physical toll of the NHL season. General Manager Doug Armstrong and his staff have prioritized immediate physical readiness, evidenced by the inclusion of Jarvis and the earlier addition of Sam Bennett. With the preliminary round opener against Czechia set for February 11, management acted decisively to ensure a full, healthy lineup is in place before logistics become complex.

### The Decision on Brayden Point

Point's Olympic hopes were derailed on January 12, 2026, when he suffered a significant right leg injury against the Philadelphia Flyers [[NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/news/seth-jarvis-replaces-injured-brayden-point-for-team-canada-in-olympics)]. The incident sidelined the Tampa Bay Lightning forward for weeks, though management delayed a final decision to allow for potential recovery.

In a final push to demonstrate fitness, Point participated in an optional skate on the morning of February 5 [[The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7024250/2026/02/05/canada-olympics-brad-marchand-brayden-point-injury/)]. Lightning General Manager and Team Canada assistant GM Julien BriseBois personally observed the session to assess Point's viability for tournament play [[Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/lightning-star-brayden-point-olympic-165927132.html)].

However, the non-contact session proved insufficient to guarantee readiness for high-intensity competition. Citing the risk of lingering issues, Team Canada officially ruled Point out later that day [[NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/news/seth-jarvis-replaces-injured-brayden-point-for-team-canada-in-olympics)].

### Seth Jarvis Enters the Fold

Seth Jarvis fills the vacancy carrying significant momentum. Before the call-up, he recorded 43 points (25 goals, 18 assists) in 48 games during the 2025-26 campaign [[NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/news/seth-jarvis-replaces-injured-brayden-point-for-team-canada-in-olympics)]. This production outpaces Point's pre-injury totals of 30 points in 37 games [[NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/news/seth-jarvis-replaces-injured-brayden-point-for-team-canada-in-olympics)].

While losing Point's defensive acumen, the roster gains a high-energy finishing dynamic. Management expects Jarvis to translate his current NHL scoring touch to the international stage immediately.

Jarvis also brings international pedigree, having won gold with Team Canada at the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off [[NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/news/seth-jarvis-replaces-injured-brayden-point-for-team-canada-in-olympics)]. This recent experience acclimated him to the pressures of national team competition, smoothing his rapid ascent to the Olympic roster.

### Strict Logistics and Deadlines

Logistics dictated the decision timeline. General Manager Doug Armstrong sought to finalize the roster before the team's scheduled travel day on February 7, despite the later official deadline [[The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7024250/2026/02/05/canada-olympics-brad-marchand-brayden-point-injury/)].

A strict policy against traveling reserves required all players to be medically cleared before boarding [[Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/lightning-star-brayden-point-olympic-165927132.html)]. This forced a definitive "go or no-go" decision on Point and allows the coaching staff to integrate Jarvis immediately upon arrival in Europe [[NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/news/seth-jarvis-replaces-injured-brayden-point-for-team-canada-in-olympics)].

### A Roster in Flux: Bennett Replaces Cirelli

Jarvis is the second major replacement forward to join the squad. Florida Panthers center Sam Bennett previously replaced Anthony Cirelli, who sustained an injury during the 2026 Stadium Series [[Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/lightning-star-brayden-point-olympic-165927132.html)].

Bennett restores defensive depth while adding a distinct physical element. Both he and Jarvis join as full participants rather than alternates, ensuring the team maintains a compliant 25-man roster despite the season's attrition.

### Lingering Concerns: The Marchand Situation

Further adjustments remain possible as the team prepares to depart. Boston Bruins forward Brad Marchand missed part of a game on February 5, raising concerns about his availability just as the Point situation was resolved.

While some reports viewed the exit as ominous [[Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/florida-panthers/news/panthers-brad-marchand-injury-update-bad-news-team-canada-olympics/7c543f997496e9bf414cf493)], others indicated Marchand is "ready to go" [[The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7024250/2026/02/05/canada-olympics-brad-marchand-brayden-point-injury/)]. Management continues to monitor the situation closely to avoid further roster volatility.

### Conclusion

Team Canada heads to Italy with a reshaped but elite roster. While the loss of Point and Cirelli alters tactical options, the addition of Sam Bennett and **Seth Jarvis** ensures high-end offensive production and resilience. Jarvis enters the tournament on a scoring tear, offering a dynamic solution to the sudden vacancy. As the squad prepares for their February 11 opener against Czechia, the expectation of a gold medal performance remains firmly in place.
