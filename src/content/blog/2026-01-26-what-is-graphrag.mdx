## GraphRAG in brief

GraphRAG models relationships between document chunks as a graph so the retrieval-generation
process can preserve **connected context**. It complements pure vector search with relationship
and hierarchy signals that are easy to miss.

## When to use it

- Domains where relationships matter (wikis, policy docs, org charts, dependency graphs)
- When “A influences B” style relationships are central to the answer
- When connectivity across documents affects quality more than any single document

## Design considerations

1. **Chunk strategy**: Manage sections plus linking nodes (titles/headers) as nodes together.
2. **Graph construction**: Create edges from links, heading hierarchy, and shared entities.
3. **Hybrid retrieval**: Narrow candidates with vector search, then expand with graph neighbors.

## Example flow

1. Embed the question and retrieve top K documents with vector search.
2. Expand graph neighbors of those documents to increase candidate context.
3. Deduplicate and summarize/normalize before sending to the LLM.

## Caveats

- Expanding the graph too far increases noise.
- Unclear relation definitions can confuse the model.
- Build cost is high, so adopt selectively for MVPs.

## Quick checklist

- Is vector search alone insufficient for accuracy?
- Is relationship information central to the question?
- Is the impact worth the build and ops cost?

Ultimately, GraphRAG excels when **relationship-based context** is critical.
