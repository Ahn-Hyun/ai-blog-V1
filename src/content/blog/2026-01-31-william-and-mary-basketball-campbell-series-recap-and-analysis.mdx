### Women's Basketball: Offensive Struggles vs. Campbell

The weekend began on a somber note as the women's team hosted Campbell on January 30. The contest ended in a 63-54 setback for the Tribe. This result highlighted the difficulties the team faced in generating consistent offense against the Fighting Camels' defense [William & Mary Athletics](https://tribeathletics.com/news/2026/1/30/womens-basketball-rally-falls-short-in-loss-to-campbell.aspx).

While the game remained competitive, statistical deficiencies on the offensive end prevented the Tribe from closing the gap. The nine-point margin of defeat underscored the impact of missed opportunities. In a game decided by single digits, the lack of shooting efficiency proved to be a decisive metric [Women's Basketball Rally Falls Short in Loss to Campbell - William & Mary Athletics](https://tribeathletics.com/news/2026/1/30/womens-basketball-rally-falls-short-in-loss-to-campbell.aspx).

#### Statistical Inefficiencies
A primary factor in the loss was the team's struggle to convert field goals. The Tribe finished shooting just 37.5% from the floor. This rate made it difficult to keep pace with Campbell's scoring output and suggested the offense faced resistance finding high-quality shots in the paint [William & Mary Athletics](https://tribeathletics.com/news/2026/1/30/womens-basketball-rally-falls-short-in-loss-to-campbell.aspx).

Perimeter shooting offered little relief. William & Mary connected on just 29.4% of their attempts from three-point range. This sub-30% performance limited the team's ability to stretch the opposing defense or generate quick points to cut into the deficit [Women's Basketball Rally Falls Short in Loss to Campbell - William & Mary Athletics](https://tribeathletics.com/news/2026/1/30/womens-basketball-rally-falls-short-in-loss-to-campbell.aspx).

#### Ball Security and Roster Rotation
Ball security issues presented the most significant hurdle to the Tribe's flow. The team recorded 22 turnovers, severely limiting their total possessions. These frequent interruptions prevented the offense from establishing rhythm and afforded Campbell additional scoring chances [Women's Basketball Rally Falls Short in Loss to Campbell - William & Mary Athletics](https://tribeathletics.com/news/2026/1/30/womens-basketball-rally-falls-short-in-loss-to-campbell.aspx).

Despite the loss, the game provided clarity on the active rotation. Cassidy Geddes and Alexa Mikeska established their status as current contributors, supported by Natalie Fox, Kyah Smith, Monet Dance, and Jana Sallman. Despite the efforts of this group, the team faced challenges on the boards, securing only 29 total rebounds [Women's Basketball Rally Falls Short in Loss to Campbell - William & Mary Athletics](https://tribeathletics.com/news/2026/1/30/womens-basketball-rally-falls-short-in-loss-to-campbell.aspx).
