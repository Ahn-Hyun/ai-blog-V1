### Legal Charges and Defense Strategy Overview

The following table outlines the different categories of charges **Marius Borg Hiby** faces and the corresponding legal approaches.

| Charge Category | Defense Rationale | Defense Perspective | Legal Risk | Potential Sentence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### Key Factors in the Case

The legal proceedings are influenced by several aggravating and mitigating factors that will shape the outcome.

**Factors Complicating the Defense**
*   **Recidivism Risk:** Police have previously requested detention based on a risk of reoffending following arrests in 2024 [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norway-crown-princess-mette-marit-son-marius-hoiby-arrest-assault-trial-rape/).
*   **Substance Abuse History:** The defendant has admitted to using violence while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine, and charges involve the possession of illegal substances [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/son-norways-crown-princess-stands-trial-rape-domestic-violence-2026-02-03/).
*   **Scope of Indictment:** The case has expanded from a single incident to a comprehensive list of charges covering conduct from 2018 through 2024 [Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/timeline-of-marius-borg-hibys-legal-troubles-and-charges).

**Factors Favoring the Defense Strategy**
*   **Bifurcated Pleas:** By pleading guilty to lesser offenses, the defense aims to separate admitted reckless behavior from the contested specific intent required for rape convictions [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/son-norways-crown-princess-stands-trial-rape-domestic-violence-2026-02-03/).
*   **Addiction Context:** The defense has framed much of the behavior within the context of a long-term struggle with addiction, potentially mitigating the perceived malice in some instances [Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/timeline-of-marius-borg-hibys-legal-troubles-and-charges).
*   **Equal Legal Standard:** The court has explicitly stated Hiby will be treated as any other citizen, preventing the prosecution from overcharging solely due to his high profile [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/son-norways-crown-princess-stands-trial-rape-domestic-violence-2026-02-03/).

### Scope of Charges and Timeline

The legal case against **Marius Borg Hiby** encompasses a timeframe stretching back several years. According to the indictment, the period covering alleged sexual offenses began in January 2018 and continued through November 2024. Additionally, investigators identified a specific window of alleged violence and threats directed at a former partner between the summer of 2022 and the fall of 2023 [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norway-crown-princess-mette-marit-son-marius-hoiby-arrest-assault-trial-rape/).

**Escalation of Legal Troubles (2024)**
*   **August 4, 2024:** Police responded to a violent incident in Oslo's Frogner district.
*   **August 6, 2024:** Authorities arrested Hiby on suspicion of assaulting a woman.
*   **August 14, 2024:** Hiby released a statement admitting to the use of violence against his girlfriend, attributing his actions to alcohol and cocaine use and stating he had been "fighting against addiction for a longer time" [Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/timeline-of-marius-borg-hibys-legal-troubles-and-charges).
*   **November 18, 2024:** Hiby was arrested again on suspicion of rape and violating a restraining order. Police conducted a search of his residence at the Skaugum estate, detaining him for one week to facilitate the investigation [Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/timeline-of-marius-borg-hibys-legal-troubles-and-charges).

**Current Indictment Status**
The indictment represents a significant escalation from the initial reports. The most severe accusations involve counts of rape and domestic violence, to which Hiby has entered pleas of "not guilty." In contrast, he has admitted guilt to offensive sexual behavior, driving offenses (speeding, driving without a valid license), and provided a partial guilty plea to aggravated assault and reckless behavior. Charges related to the possession of controlled substances were added as the investigation concluded [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/son-norways-crown-princess-stands-trial-rape-domestic-violence-2026-02-03/).

### Impact on the Monarchy

The legal proceedings against **Marius Borg Hiby** have forced the Norwegian Royal Court to navigate a delicate distinction between private family matters and public institutional integrity. Although Hiby is the son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit, the palace has consistently emphasized that he holds no royal title, performs no official duties, and is considered "autonomous." Crown Prince Haakon has publicly addressed this tension, stating that while Hiby is a loved family member, he "will not be handled tougher or milder because he is part of this family" [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/03/europe/norway-crown-princess-epstein-hoiby-intl), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/son-norways-crown-princess-stands-trial-rape-domestic-violence-2026-02-03/).

To mitigate reputational damage, the Royal Family has adopted a strategy of physical absence regarding the legal proceedings, confirming that no members of the royal family would attend court sessions. This aligns with the Crown's assertion that the judicial process must remain independent. However, the investigation physically touched the royal sphere when police searched Hiby's home at the Skaugum estate in November 2024 [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/03/europe/norway-crown-princess-epstein-hoiby-intl), [Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/timeline-of-marius-borg-hibys-legal-troubles-and-charges).

The case has also revived broader scrutiny regarding Crown Princess Mette-Marit's judgment and past associations. Media coverage has referenced previous controversies, including her 2019 apology for meeting with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. While unrelated to the current charges against her son, these narratives contribute to a complex public relations challenge for the Crown Princess [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/03/europe/norway-crown-princess-epstein-hoiby-intl), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norway-crown-princess-mette-marit-son-marius-hoiby-arrest-assault-trial-rape/).
